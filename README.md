# A-J_Eatery_Desktop
Here I have my code for Ang And Jack's Eatery. I went for the extra credit and coded the entire site. 
I struggled with the Visit Us/visit.html page but think I did pretty good for coding my first form. All buttons and links are functional throughout the site. I do not have the establishment's social media so I had the buttons link to the social medias' login page. 

I couldn't figure out the Pages aspect of this program (GitHub) so like my last assignment I have a zip file that can be downloaded and viewed on your own desktop. All html pages are connected so it doesn't matter which html you choose to open first, although I suggest the home.html first.
